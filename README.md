# TextEditor
A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files. A plain text file is represented and edited by showing all the characters as they are present in the file. The only characters usable for 'mark-up' are the control characters of the used character set; in practice this is newline, tab and form feed. The most commonly used character set is ASCII especially recently, as plain text files are more often being used for programming and configuration, and less frequently for documentation (e.g. detailed instructions, user guides) than in the past.
